##Paint with Metal
Simple paint application to demo Metal. Metal only offer basic primitives: dot, line, and triangle, so painting might not look very smooth as all the lines were drawn using triangles.

As Metal framework only works on Apple's 64bit arch cpu, you won't be able to run on simulator.
